## Features

The user is presented with a simple interface for searching for the weather of a city. 

When a city in the OneWeather API is entered, the user is presented with current and future conditions for the requested city.

The current weather conditions card for the requested city provides the user city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index.

The future weather conditions for the requested city provides the user with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity.
